# pandas_challenge

This PyCitySchools Challenge was constructed mostly of my own coding and skill. I however would like to acknowledge the conbtributors that make up the remainder of it. Those would be, my instructor James Torres, TA Alexis Carpenter, my classmate Rebbekkah Alexander, two broken Ai modules that I can't name due to contractual obligantions, and ChatGPT.
The analysis of the data post coding however is all me. Thank you for stopping by, I hope you enjoyed the read.
